Faux Mail/Lonely Mail
=====================
Try it out [here](http://gabefinch.github.io/lonely-mail/).
A js web app built with Ember.js. All dependencies are included.
Lonely Mail is a simplistic "email" client interface that allows creation of
emails. All emails created are added to the inbox, as though the user is
stuck inside an evil echo chamber or hall-of-mirrors.  This was in keeping with
the assignment. Strange, no?

Motivation
----------
Created in one day during a week of Ember.js training at Epicodus
Practice on basic Ember routing, data handling, and controller logic.


Installation and Usage
------------
To run the app locally, clone this repository.
From within the project directory type this into your terminal (MacOSX):

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then open up `localhost:8000` in your web browser

or try it out [here](http://gabefinch.github.io/lonely-mail/).
