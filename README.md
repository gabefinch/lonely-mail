A simple example app built with Ember.js. All dependencies are included.

Because the app uses AJAX to load templates, you cannot open `index.html` from the `file://` protocol. Instead, you must start a web server to load your app. The easiest way to start a web server is to download [Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml), copy it into your project directory, and open it up. Alternatively, on a Mac, you can run `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from your project directly, and then in your browser, visit http://0.0.0.0:8000.
